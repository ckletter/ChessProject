2/12/23 - Cody Kletter ChessGame

This program operates by being able to move pieces
on a chess board using user input in the console and painting the board in a GUI

This game does not yet have a win screen given that the entire Chess game backend has not yet been coded.
To be implemented:
Checks, valid piece moves, checkmate, stalemate, castling, etc.
